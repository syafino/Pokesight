## Project Summary

PokéSight is a web-based application designed to empower Pokémon Go players by providing a smart, data-driven map of Pokémon locations. By integrating a comprehensive dataset of Pokémon statistics with a database of historical spawn locations, our app offers more than just a simple map. It allows users to perform highly specific searches, such as finding all "Legendary" rarity Pokémon with an attack stat above 250 within a five-mile radius.
The core mission of PokéSight is to transform the often random and time-consuming process of hunting for specific Pokémon into a more strategic and rewarding experience. Instead of wandering aimlessly, players can use our platform to identify spawning locations for the types of Pokémon they need, saving time and increasing their chances of success. The app will feature sophisticated filtering options by Pokémon characteristics and/or geographical sightings.
